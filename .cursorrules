# AI Agent Instructions for image-generator-mcp-server in Cursor

## MCP Server Workflow

### üîÑ Change-Build-Test Cycle

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. Make code changes to the MCP server
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Link the package: `npm link`
4. Ask the user to restart Cursor
5. **WAIT** for explicit confirmation from the user that they have restarted Cursor
6. Only AFTER confirmation, proceed with testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why restarting is critical**: 
> - Cursor only establishes connections to MCP servers at startup and doesn't automatically reconnect when the underlying binary is updated
> - Without restarting Cursor, you'll either see "Not connected" errors or the **old code will continue running**
> - Any changes you've made won't take effect until Cursor is restarted, even if the tools appear to be working

### üß™ Testing with DALLE Image Generation

Once the user has confirmed Cursor restart, test the MCP server functionality:

```
mcp_dalle_generate_image({
  prompt: "A beautiful mountain landscape", 
  outputPath: "/Users/yourusername/Pictures/generated_images/mountains"
})
```

#### Output Details

- Images are saved to the exact path specified in `outputPath`
- Directory structures are created automatically if they don't exist
- The `.png` extension is added automatically if not included in the path 

### üì¶ Publishing to npm

When ready to publish or update the package on npm:

1. Ensure all changes are committed to Git: 
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

2. Update the version number (following semantic versioning):
   ```
   npm version patch  # For bug fixes
   npm version minor  # For new features
   npm version major  # For breaking changes
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Publish to npm:
   ```
   npm publish
   ```

5. For first-time publishing with a scoped package:
   ```
   npm publish --access public
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Only publish when explicitly instructed to do so, and after thorough testing.
