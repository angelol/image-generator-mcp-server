# Cursor Rules for image-generator-mcp-server

## MCP Server Workflow

### 🔄 Change-Build-Test Cycle

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. Make code changes to the MCP server
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Link the package: `npm link`
4. Ask the user to restart Cursor
5. **WAIT** for explicit confirmation from the user that they have restarted Cursor
6. Only AFTER confirmation, proceed with testing

> ⚠️ **Why restarting is critical**: 
> - Cursor only establishes connections to MCP servers at startup and doesn't automatically reconnect when the underlying binary is updated
> - Without restarting Cursor, you'll either see "Not connected" errors or the **old code will continue running**
> - Any changes you've made won't take effect until Cursor is restarted, even if the tools appear to be working

### 🧪 Testing with DALLE Image Generation

Once the user has confirmed Cursor restart, test the MCP server functionality:

```
mcp_dalle_generate_image({
  prompt: "A beautiful mountain landscape", 
  outputPath: "/Users/yourusername/Pictures/generated_images/mountains"
})
```

#### Output Details

- Images are saved to the exact path specified in `outputPath`
- Directory structures are created automatically if they don't exist
- The `.png` extension is added automatically if not included in the path
